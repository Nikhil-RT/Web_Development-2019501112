        <p>Hi there, I'm Nikhil Ravi Teja</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I had completed my B.tech on Civil engineering at JNTU kakinada (2015-2019).</li>
            <li>The IT field had been one of my interests since my bachelors.</li>
            <li>I had decided to pursue my masters in IT.</li>
            <li>Now, here i'am pursuing my masters on IT at IIIT Hyderabad.</li>
            <li>MSIT gave me a chance to work on real time projects. </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 style="background-color: lightblue;">About MSIT :</h2>
        <p>MSIT (MS in IT or Master of Science in Information Technology) is a two year post graduate program in Computer Science started in 2001. MSIT is an innovative multi-university interdisciplinary post-graduate program. MSIT program is being offered by “Consortium of Institutions of Higher Learning” (CIHL), formed by the Universities. Under MOU with CMU, some Carnegie Mellon Researchers are providing guidance on the course content.</p>
        <p>Msit provides two types of courses :</p>
        <ol>
            <li>IT Courses</li>
            <li>Soft Skills</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 style="background-color: lightblue;">Available Courses and Experience :</h2>

        <p>1. What about NON-IT students, how can they cope up with students ?</p>
        <p>Most students who start the MSIT program are not from Computer Science or Information Technology branches of engineering. Independent of that, almost all the students do not have the necessary CS background knowledge when they join MSIT. </p>
